# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my **SQL expertise** by solving real-world **E-Commerce sales analysis** problems.  
Using SQL, I extracted, cleaned, and transformed raw transactional data to answer **business-critical questions**, and finally used **Power BI** to visualize the insights.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (Core Project)** → Data Cleaning, Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Subqueries  
- **Power BI (Support)** → Dashboarding & KPI Visualization  
- **Excel** → Data Pre-processing & Validation  

---

## 🧑‍💻 SQL Contributions
I focused on writing efficient and optimized SQL queries to solve analytical problems such as:

### 🔸 Revenue Analysis
- Total Revenue, Monthly/Yearly Trends  
- Revenue per City, Category, Payment Method  

### 🔸 Customer Analysis
- Repeat vs One-time Customers  
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)  
- Top Contributing Customers  

### 🔸 Return Analysis
- Return % calculation using CASE expressions  
- Identifying high-return products & categories  

### 🔸 Performance Analysis
- Top-performing cities and product categories  
- Payment success/failure breakdown

## 🔍 SQL Techniques Used
- **Joins** → Combined multiple tables (orders, customers, payments, returns, products)  
- **CTEs** → Built stepwise queries for complex transformations  
- **Subqueries** → Used for nested calculations & filtering top results  
- **Window Functions** → Used ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and PARTITION BY to find:
  - Top customers per city  
  - Best-selling products  
  - Ranking categories by revenue  
- **Aggregate Functions** → SUM, AVG, COUNT for KPIs  
- **CASE Expressions** → Return percentage, customer segmentation  
- **Date Functions** → Extracted year, month for trend analysis

## 📊 Key Business KPIs Derived
| KPI | Description | Value |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 💰 Total Revenue | Total generated sales | ₹46.6M |
| 📉 Amount Lost (Returns) | Returned product losses | ₹12.9M |
| 🔁 Return % | Return ratio | 27.6% |
| 👥 Customer Lifetime Value | John Well | ₹2.2M |
| 🔂 Repeat Customer Ratio | Repeat vs One Time customers | 41.9% VS 58.9% |
| 🏙️ City-wise Revenue | Williamsfort | ₹2.2M |

## 📈 Dashboard Features (Power BI)
While **SQL** was the core of the project, the results were visualized in **Power BI** for storytelling:
- KPIs (Revenue, CLTV, Returns, Repeat Ratio)
- Filters for City, Category, Customer Type
- Drill-through analysis for customer insights
- Interactive trend analysis

---

## 🎯 Outcomes
✔️ Showcased ability to solve complex business problems with SQL  
✔️ Optimized queries for clean, efficient analysis  
✔️ Derived actionable insights that can drive business strategy  
✔️ Enhanced storytelling with Power BI (SQL as the backbone)

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project proves how **SQL alone can power analytical problem-solving** and enable data-driven decision-making.  
**Power BI** was used purely for visualization — the real intelligence lies in the **SQL logic**.
